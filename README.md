# Console-Exploits-All-Website

*Console hacks are pieces of codes that change the appearance of the web page but only in client side (locally), this means that only you will see these changes, and by reloading the page, they will disappear.*

## ***1.Edit everything***

This code enable to edit everything in that page. This is useful to take fake screenshots. Reloading the page they will disappear.

```js
document.designMode = 'on'
```

## ***2.Change Font***

This code changes the font of any web page. You can change the font in any font you want.

```js
let newStyle = document.createElement('style');
newStyle.innerHTML = 'body { font-family: "Font Name"}'
document.head.appendChild(newStyle);
```

If other elements on the page (h1, etc.) have font family assigned to them, you will need to add those element names after "body" (body, h1, ...).
